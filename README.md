# important

i have 2 submissions, the seocnd one (ServiceTitanRound1Code2) was made a bit after 6 PM.
i was working and realized that product name can be used to fill product id and order id data
the data fetched from the second algortihm is under the new data folder. this is done so to prevent any naming problems within the two dataframes.

if that submissions is unaccepted, please review ST2025Round1 that was submitted before 6 PM
